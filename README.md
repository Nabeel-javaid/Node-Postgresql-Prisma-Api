# Node-Postgresql-Prisma-Api
 
NodeJs api that uses the express framework and managed postgresql by neon as a database. Used Prisma as ORM tool to interact with the database. Split the code nicely into routes and handlers to separate the business logic from the routes. Typescript for better type handling.
